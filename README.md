# Vorlesungsplan+ for DHBW Mosbach

The Vorlesungsplan+ app is intended to be an alternative to the official stuv survival/stuv companion app of the DHBW Mosbach.
In contrast to the offical app, this app offers a cross-plattform unified look and feel. This app is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that allows you to "install" the app to your native device. Alternatively this app can be wrapped into a native android and iOS app although this feature is not implemented yet.

This app is live on: https://dhbw.rickstack.de

## Features

1. Show all lectures for selected course at the DHBW Mosbach
2. Show upcoming events
3. Create and manage tasks that you need to do for your lectures
4. Cross-platform

## Backend

A custom backend is used for receiving lectures, courses and events. For more details see: https://api.rickstack.de/help

## Technologies

Vorlesungsplan+ is built with Angular (JavaScript Framework), Ionic Framework and Capacitor (tool for using native features on web applications & wraps web app into native android and ios app)
